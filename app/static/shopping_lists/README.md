# Shopping Lists

This directory serves as the export target for generated shopping lists. After 
creation, they are put into a response and will be downloaded via the 
browser. The file is deleted afterwards, but can be regenerated. 

To be completely honest, this README exists only to make sure, the directory 
is created on deploy...
